PSUdoMRI 2011b FAQ by Zhipeng Cao (Jan.2012)

=====================================

1>> What are the system requirements to run PSUdoMRI?
Operating System: Windows.
MATLAB: 2007a or later.
RAM: 4G or above recommended.

(If you would like to run it on a non-windows platform, or on an older version of MATLAB, please contact me that I will be very happy to help you.)

2>> A first time user: Why my signal calculation is so slow?

Possible solutions:
1) Are you using a multi-threaded computer? Did you set a right thread number?
2) Did you try adjusting the mins & maxs that the simulator will input only a few slices of the model for calculation of signal?

3>> What is the difference between SimpleSignal mode and AdvancedSignal mode?

In SimpleSignal mode the system performs a RF calibration to determine the transmit voltage. In AdvancedSignal Mode this process is replaced by assuming the mean transmit B field in the object to be 5.8718524e-007 Tesla, and the transmit voltage is calculated on that. SimpleSignal mode is better suited for educational purposes, while AdvancedSignal mode better for researches, especially for multi-Tx studies.

The SAR calculation has the same mechanism as the AdvancedSignal mode.

4>> It seems the current release is for x64 system. What if I want to run it on a x86 system?

Under the Engine folder, you will find engines built for x86 system. You just need to rename them for it to be run.

5>> How can I access the k-space data and reconstruct the image with my own recon method?

An example file "testSignal.m" is located in "Others" folder.
