Hi Dan,

Pls. find attached a Matlab routine which calculates a uniform distribution of N point charges (coils) on the surface of a unit-sphere. For small N this routine basically always finds a global minimum; i.e. for N=4, 6, 8, 12, and 20 it finds the corresponding Platonic solids (i.e. convex regular polyhedrons: Tetrahedron(N=4), Cube(N=6), Octahedron(N=8), Dodecahedron(N=12), and Icosahedron(N=20)).
For larger N the optimization typically gets stuck in a local minimum.
In such cases it makes sense to repeat the optimization a number of times.

Best regards,
- Florian.

PS: Ev. the algorithm can be improved by explicitly providing the gradient of the cost function (i.e. the electrostatic potential) to the Matlab non-linear optimization routine.

> Hello again, Florian.  This time I write to you regarding a matter of science rather than career.  My student Riccardo Lattanzi and I are trying to replicate the work in your thesis and ISMRM abstract on approaching ultimate SNR with finite coil arrays.  In addition to being a useful conceptual tool, this will be very helpful for Riccardo in validating his ultimate intrinsic coil performance maps, which have been criticized for showing excessively poor performance of the actual coil arrays we have evaluated with respect to ultimate intrinsic SNR.  Your exposition in the thesis is characteristically clear.  However, it would help us to be sure of our results if you could provide a little more information about the packing of circular coils on the sphere.  Might you be able to track down and provide to us a list of the actual angular position of each coil center for the cases you studied (N = 4, 8, 16, 32, 64)?   Riccardo is working on implementing the optimization in your Eq. 2.72, but it would be helpful for him to be able to check his work.
